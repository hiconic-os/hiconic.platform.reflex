# The hiconic reflex platform

Hiconic reflex (aka RX) aims to be a platform for __modeled micro-services__ with attention to:

* fast startup and response time 
* interface based POJO models as first class citizens
* efficient and elegant generic data processing
* normalized cross cutting concerns for services
* modularity and extensibility
* convention over configuration
* simple, yet flexible configuration
* modeled error handling
* location agnostic modeled services for caller and callee
* service portability by separation of concerns
  * format (json, yaml, efficient binary, ...)
  * transport (HTTP, message queue, CLI, ...)
  * protocol (REST, GraphQl, ...)
  * mapping (URL, message-body, form-data, CLI args, ...)

## Demo

To get in touch without further ado you can take a first glance at the platform with help of [demos](./readme/demo/demo.md).

## Building Your Own Application

Get started and learn how to [build our own application](./readme/getting-started/getting-started.md)  from a model and a module with a few steps.
