# The _Hiconic_ _Reflex_ Platform

_Hiconic_ _Reflex_ (aka RX) aims to be a platform for __modeled micro-services__ with attention to:

* fast startup and response time 
* interface based POJO models as first class citizens
* efficient and elegant generic data processing
* normalized cross cutting concerns for services
* modularity and extensibility
* convention over configuration
* simple, yet flexible configuration
* modeled error handling
* modeled services, location agnostic for caller and callee
* service portability by separation of concerns
  * format (JSON, YAML, efficient binary, ...)
  * transport (HTTP, message queue, CLI, ...)
  * protocol (REST, GraphQL, ...)
  * mapping (URL, message-body, form-data, CLI arguments, ...)
